      <p>
        Recently, the Trump administration announced a substantial reduction in NASA's budget, slashing nearly half of the funding allocated to its science division. The administration justified the budget cuts by labeling these programs as inefficient and not aligned with their strategic priorities.

        Let’s take a view of astronomy from their perspective. This image shows the Carina Nebula, a vast cloud of gas and dust in interstellar space where countless stars are born. It takes light approximately 460 years to cross from one edge of this very beautiful nebula to the other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The image of this nebula was taken using the James Webb Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021. 
        The James Webb Space Telescope cost almost 10 billion dollars to build and maintain. To help you understand how big that number is, imagine feeding everyone in Kenya, a country with people who starve due to its poverty, twice a day for two and a half months, that’s how much money it took. Even costing this much money, the telescope won’t last forever; it’s designed to work for about 20 years.
