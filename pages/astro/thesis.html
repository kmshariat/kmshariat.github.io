    <h1>Astronomy and the Prisoner of Bangladeshi Thesis</h1>

    <img src="dedication_thesis.png" alt="Dedication" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />

    <p>
      As some of you know, I am currently enrolled as an undergrad at Shahjalal University 
      of Science and Technology, Bangladesh majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
      But my area of interest was in astronomical data filtering, modelling and analysis. 
      Specifically I worked on <b>Transiting Exoplanets Data</b>. Defending my thesis felt like navigating Mirpur‚Äôs legendary roads: every step 
      jolted by unexpected potholes, but somehow I still reached the destination. I'll be sharing 
      my journey in this blog and may eventually suggest you some <b>do</b>s and <b>don't</b>s if you are 
      planning to take a thesis on astronomy from Bangladesh from an engineering background.
    </p>    


    <h2>Selecting Supervisor</h2>
    <p>
      If you are an engineering student and hoping to do your thesis in astronomy, GOOD LUCK! üò™ 
      In Bangladesh, many undergraduates don‚Äôt get the opportunity to propose their own 
      problem statement or work on their area of interest. Sometimes, the thesis supervisor 
      is assigned by lottery and you must work on whatever topic they choose without much say in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>  
      But if you do get a choice (and you must create one) then choose a supervisor who 
      is flexible, empathetic and allows you freedom in your research. Here‚Äôs what 
      worked for me: I immersed myself in research papers on a specific field of 
      astronomy namely exoplanets and prepared a presentation summarizing the 
      literatures and a potential problem statement. I then approached my supervisor 
      with this, showing my passion and progress with regular updates. 
      I was fortunate enough that my dedication paid off and he agreed to supervise my work on exoplanets.
    </p>


    <h2>Readings</h2>
    <p>

      After you have finalized your area of interest, the next step is to read the related 
      literatures. One thing is you can search related papers on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">
        Google Scholar</a> or on <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/">NASA ADS</a> or you can directly
        ask LLMs like Perplexity AI to give you the related papers. For this specific task, Perplexity works 
        better than ChatGPT in my experience.

    </p>

    <p>

      ‚ùå Don't: Read research papers at your infancy. You will not understand most of the jargons 
      and it'll make you feel like you are not cut out for this. <br>
      ‚úÖ Do: Read thesis papers on related topics. They are usually written in a more
      beginner-friendly way and will help you understand the basics of the field.

    </p>

    <h2>Track Progress</h2>

    <p>

      Most students start their thesis when the defense date is knocking at the door. It's 
      a very bad idea. Present your progress (even if it's small) to your
      supervisor on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Create a project tracker on google docs
      to keep the meeting minutes and related suggestions from your supervisor.

    </p>

    <h2>Reference Management</h2>

    <p>

      Use a reference management tool like <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> or <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> to keep track of your references. 
      It will save you a lot of time and effort when writing your thesis. I personally used Mendeley 
      and it worked great for me.

    </p>

    <h2>Visualization</h2>

    <p>

      I am assuming that you'll use python for your astronomy research. Use libraries like
      <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> or <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> for data visualization.
      Make the images look academic and professional. You can follow this video to create 
      publication-ready figures: <a href="https://youtu.be/i-HAjex6VtM?si=anZ8W-bx4b8Yph8n">Principles of Beautiful Figures for Research Papers </a>.
      Save the figures in pdf format for better quality and smaller file size. 
      You should be careful that, if the figures are too large, Overleaf may not compile your LaTex codes.
    </p>

    <h2>Don't Lose Hope!</h2>

    <p>

    As Emily Dickinson said, <b>Hope is the thing with feathers.</b> Be prepared
    that most of the people around you will not understand your work. They may even
    discourage you. They may mock you during your defense. But don't lose hope.
