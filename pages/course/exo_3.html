    <h1>Radial Velocity Method</h1>

    <h2>Spectra</h2>

    <p>Stars produce light that radiates in every direction and interacts with various 
    substances in space. The different wavelengths of light can be seen then passed through a prism.
    This makes a band of VIBGYOR which is called a spectrum. Spectra is called the 'fingerprint' of a star. It contains information about the 
    chemical composition of the star. If the light from a star passes through a
    gas cloud, the gas absorbs some of the light at specific wavelengths, creating
    dark lines in the spectrum. These dark lines are called absorption lines. The
    pattern of absorption lines is unique to each element, allowing astronomers to
    identify the elements present in the star's atmosphere.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>
    Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it has a unique
    absorption spectrum with absorptions lines located at 6563 Å (\(H\alpha\)) and 4861 Å (\(H\beta\)).
    The \(H\alpha\) spectral line corresponds to the wavelength emitted when an electron transitions 
    from the third energy level (\(n=3\)) to the second energy level (\(n=2\)) in the hydrogen atom. 
    Similarly, the \(H\beta\) spectral line represents the wavelength produced when an electron 
    moves from the fourth orbit (\(n=4\)) down to the second orbit (\(n=2\)).
    </p>
  <p>
    The general formula for the wavelength emitted during such transitions is given by:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) 
    \]


    For \(H \alpha\) line (\(n=3\) to \(n=2\))
  <p>
    \[
      \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{H}\alpha}} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right) = R_H \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right) \Rightarrow \lambda_{\text{H}\alpha} = 6563 \text{Å}
    \]
  </p>

  For \(H \beta\) line (\(n=4\) to \(n=2\))
  <p>
    \[
      \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{H}\beta}} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) = R_H \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} \right) \Rightarrow \lambda_{\text{H}\beta} = 4861 \text{Å}
    \]


    So, if we observe a spectra from a star, and the spectra has two black lines at 6563 Å and 4861 Å, we can conclude that the star has hydrogen in its atmosphere.

    <h2>Radial Velocity</h2>

    <p>
        When a massive planet orbits a star at a close distance, it exerts a gravitational pull that causes the
        star to undergo a wobble motion. This stellar wobble can be detected by observing periodic shifts
        in the star&apos;s spectral lines, caused by the Doppler effect through high-precision spectroscopy. If
        the star is approaching the observer then the absorption lines of the spectra gets red shifted. If the
        star is receding away from the observer then the absorption lines of the spectra gets blue shifted.
        By measuring these shifts, astronomers can determine the star&apos;s radial velocity semi-amplitude
        \(K \), minimum mass of the planet \(M_p \sin{i} \) etc.

    <h2>Derivations</h2>
    <p>
    Otto Struve, a Russian astronomer, was the first to propose the radial velocity method in 1952. 
    In his proposal, he suggested that "stellar companions can exist at very small distances. It is 
    not unreasonable that a planet might exist at a distance of 1/50 astronomical unit, or 
    about 3,000,000 km. Its period around a star of solar mass would then be about 1 day." </p>

    <p>We know from Newtonian Mechanics that an object of mass \(m\) orbiting with \(T\) period around another 
    object of mass \(M\) interacts according to the following relation </p>

    \[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}R^3 \]

    <p>But we also know from motion in a circular path that </p>
    $$v = \omega R \Rightarrow v = \frac{2\pi}{T}R$$

    <p>Solving it for \(R\) we get</p>
    $$R = \frac{vT}{2\pi}$$

    <p>Putting the value of \(R\) in Kepler's third law, we get </p>
    $$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \frac{v^3 T^3}{8\pi^3}$$

    <p>Solving it for \(v\) we get </p>
    $$v^3 = (2\pi GM) \frac{1}{T} \Rightarrow v^3 \propto \frac{1}{T}$$

    <p>This is Kepler's trird law of planetary motion in a different form. </p>

    We will now determine the radial velocity of the Sun due to the effect of Jupiter but at a distance of 1/50 AU. If Jupiter is placed at a  distance of 1/50 AU then
    
    $$ \text{Gravitational Constant }G = 6.673 \times 10^{-11}$$
    $$\text{Distance of the Planet }R = 1/ 50 \text{AU} = 3\times 10^9 m$$
    $$\text{Mass of the Star } M_r = 2 \times 10^{30} kg$$
    $$\text{Mass of Planet } M_p = M_j = 1.89 \times 10^{27} kg$$

    <p>The velocity of the planet is</p>
    $$V_p = \sqrt{\frac{GM_r}{R}} = \sqrt{\frac{6.673\times10^{-11} \times2\times 10^{30}}{3\times 10^9}} = 210 km/s$$
  
    <p>From Orbital Mechanics</p> 

    $$M_r V_r = M_p V_p$$

    <p>Putting the value to the aforementioned equation we get the radial velocity of the star:</p>
    $$V_r = \left( \frac{M_p}{M_r} \right)V_p = \left(\frac{1.89\times10^{27}}{2\times 10^{30}}\right) 210 = 0.2 km/s$$

    <p>If a planet is at distance 1/50 AU and has 10 times the mass of Jupiter then it's velocity would be 2 km/s which is detectable using spectrographs. 
      This is true for inclination angle \(i = 90^\circ\). Remember that \(k = \frac{M_r}{M_j}\) also called the mass scaling factor. </p>


    <h2>Phase Plot</h2>

    The phase plot shows how the radial velocity changes over one complete orbit of 
    the planet around the star. The x-axis represents folded time, while the y-axis 
    represents the radial velocity of the star. The maximum distance from the 
    x-axis is called the semi-amplitude denoted by \(K\).
