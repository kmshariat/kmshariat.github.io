    <h1>Introduction to Exoplanets</h1>

    <p>Extra solar planets or <i>exoplanets</i> are planets outside our solar system that orbit another star or a system
of stars other than the Sun. For centuries, humans have wondered if other worlds exist beyond our solar 
system and whether life might exist there. The concept was first seriously studied by the Epicurean school of philosophy. They believed that this universe is infinite, the number of atoms in the universe is infinite and there are infinite worlds like earth in this infinite universe. Many literatures including some early science fictions explores this idea of exoplanets including that of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's short story <i>'The Dream of a Ridiculus Man'</i>. 
The book depicts a planet orbiting a Sun-like star, inhabited by human-like beings. In 1584, Giordano Bruno talked about a concept that aligns with the concept of exoplanet in his famous book <i>De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi</i> â€”

<blockquote>
    "Thus is the excellence of God magnified and the greatness of his kingdom made manifest; he is glorified not in one, but in countless suns; not in a single earth, a single world, but in a thousand thousand, I say in an infinity of worlds." 
</blockquote>

<p>The first proposal to detect an exoplanet came from Otto Struve. He proposed that if a massive enough planet orbits the host star at a very close distance, then the center of mass of the system will be outside of the star. 
This will make the star to wobble. Using a powerful spectrometer, we can detect this stars wobble by measuring how much the absorption lines in the spectra are moving. </p>

<p>This fictional idea of discovering other planets outside our solar system came into reality when two planets were found orbiting a millisecond pulsar (a neutron star that can rotate around its axis in milliseconds)  known as PSR B1257+12 in 1992. 
    Three years later, in 1995, the first known planet orbiting around a Sun like star 51 Pegasi b was discovered and the scientists behind it were awarded the Noble Prize in Physics afterwards. From then till now (9 July 2025) 5926 exoplanets have been discovered using various methods and different missions.</p>

<p>The importance of exoplanet detection can be put forward like this. We live in a solar system with eight planets, a star and many small rocky objects. But still we don't have a clear understanding of how our solar system formed. Studying exoplanet systems can help us solve this problem. We cannot stay in this planet forever. The Sun is now a <i>main sequence star</i>. After 7.6 billion years the radius of the Sun will become 1.2 astronomical unit engulfing the earth. If civilization wants to thrive in the future, we need to find alternative habitable home for humans. The most interesting thing is, it has the potential to solve the mystery of <i>origin of life</i> problem.  If there are life on other planets, then we can study what's the similarity between our planet and their planet and what's the difference with other barren planets. For these reasons, exoplanet hunting has become one of the hot topics of astronomy. </p>  

<h2>Methods of Detection</h2>

<p>
  There are many methods to detect an exoplanet but two methods of detection dictate over them. Out of 5926 
exoplanets detected, 4224 exoplanets (71.27%) were discovered using the transit method and 1092 exoplanets 
(18.43%) were discovered using the radial velocity method.
