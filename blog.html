      <h2>How I Won the Three Minute Thesis Competition</h2>
      <p>

         Exoplanets and AI won this competition organized by the North East 
         University Bangladesh. I share what we did there.

      <h2>My Journey to Python Package Development for Astronomy</h2>
      <p>
         Participating in CODE/ASTRO workshop was a great experience for me. After a very long time,
         I felt that I was collaborating with a team where I didn't have to supervise anyone, they knew
         what they were doing. We developed a Python package called 'ExoMAFT' for Exoplanet Multi-Wavelength 
         Atomsospheric Feature Tracker just in 4 days.

      <p>Why are we becoming morons day by day? Does it have anything to do with what we say, what we read and the way we represent our thoughts?</p>
